# Elevate Labs - SQL Developer Internship | Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls

## üåü Project Overview

This repository demonstrates the successful completion of "Task 2: Data Insertion and Handling Nulls" as part of the Elevate Labs SQL Developer Internship. Building upon the robust E-commerce database schema designed in Task 1, this task focuses on populating the database with meaningful data and managing data integrity, specifically addressing the proper handling of `NULL` values and applying DML operations.

## üöÄ Data Manipulation Language (DML) Operations Deep Dive

This task involves utilizing Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands to interact with the database, ensuring data can be effectively added, modified, and removed.

### 1. `INSERT` Statements: Populating the Database

* **Purpose:** To add new rows (records) into the tables created in Task 1.
* **Implementation:** The SQL script includes `INSERT INTO` statements for various tables (`users`, `customer_profiles`, `products`, `orders`, etc.) to create a realistic dataset for an e-commerce platform.
* **Handling Nulls & Defaults:** Demonstrates inserting values into all columns, or selectively inserting into specific columns, allowing other columns to take their `DEFAULT` values or be `NULL` if permitted by the schema. Special attention is given to fields where `NULL` is appropriate (e.g., `last_login`, `address_line2`).

### 2. `UPDATE` Statements: Modifying Existing Data

* **Purpose:** To change existing data in one or more rows of a table.
* **Implementation:** The script showcases `UPDATE` statements to modify specific records (e.g., changing a user's email, updating a product's price, changing an order's status).
* **Conditional Updates:** Emphasizes the crucial role of the `WHERE` clause to target specific rows for modification, preventing unintended mass updates. Examples include updating a single customer's phone number or changing the status of multiple pending orders.

### 3. `DELETE` Statements: Removing Data

* **Purpose:** To remove existing rows from a table.
* **Implementation:** The script includes `DELETE FROM` statements to remove specific records (e.g., deleting a specific cart item, removing a cancelled order).
* **Controlled Deletion:** Highlights the importance of the `WHERE` clause in `DELETE` statements to ensure only desired rows are removed, preventing accidental data loss. Discusses how `ON DELETE CASCADE` (if defined in Task 1's schema) impacts deletion of related data.

## üìö Answers to Theoretical Questions

As per Task 2 requirements, here are the detailed answers to the theoretical database concepts related to DML and Null handling:

1.  **Difference between `NULL` and `0`?**
    * **`NULL`**: Represents the absence of a value. It means "no data," "unknown," or "not applicable." It is not equal to `0`, an empty string (`''`), or a space. `NULL` is a marker for missing or undefined information.
    * **`0`**: Represents an actual numerical value of zero. It is a specific, defined quantity. For example, `0` in a `stock_quantity` column means there are zero items, whereas `NULL` would mean the stock quantity is unknown or not recorded.

2.  **What is a default constraint?**
    A `DEFAULT` constraint is used to provide a default value for a column when no value is explicitly specified during an `INSERT` operation. If a column has a `DEFAULT` constraint and no value is given for that column, the default value is automatically inserted. This helps ensure data consistency and reduces the need for application-side handling of missing values.

3.  **How does `IS NULL` work?**
    The `IS NULL` operator is used to test for `NULL` values. Because `NULL` is not a value but a state of absence, it cannot be compared using standard comparison operators like `=`, `<`, or `>`. Instead, you use `column_name IS NULL` to check if a column's value is `NULL`, and `column_name IS NOT NULL` to check if it has a non-`NULL` value.

4.  **How do you update multiple rows?**
    You update multiple rows using the `UPDATE` statement along with a `WHERE` clause that selects more than one row. For example, `UPDATE Employees SET Status = 'Inactive' WHERE Department = 'Marketing';` would update the status for all employees in the Marketing department. Without a `WHERE` clause, the `UPDATE` statement would modify *all* rows in the table.

5.  **Can we insert partial values?**
    Yes, you can insert partial values into a table using `INSERT INTO`. When inserting partial values, you must explicitly specify the columns you are providing values for. Any columns not listed will either receive their `DEFAULT` value (if defined) or `NULL` (if the column allows `NULL`s). Columns defined with `NOT NULL` constraints that are not included in the `INSERT` statement or do not have a `DEFAULT` value will cause an error.

6.  **What happens if a `NOT NULL` field is left empty?**
    If a `NOT NULL` field (a column explicitly defined to not accept `NULL` values) is left empty (i.e., no value is provided for it during an `INSERT` or it's set to `NULL` during an `UPDATE`), the database will raise an error. This prevents records from being created or updated with missing critical information.

7.  **How do you rollback a deletion?**
    Rollback of a deletion is possible if the `DELETE` operation was part of an **active transaction**. In SQL, you can use `START TRANSACTION` (or `BEGIN TRANSACTION`), perform the `DELETE` statement, and then, if you realize it was a mistake, issue a `ROLLBACK` command. This will undo all changes made since the `START TRANSACTION` command. If `COMMIT` has already been executed, or if the `DELETE` was performed outside an explicit transaction (e.g., in `autocommit` mode, which is often the default), the deletion cannot be rolled back without a database backup.

8.  **Can we insert values into specific columns only?**
    Yes, absolutely. To insert values into specific columns, you must list the column names explicitly after the table name in the `INSERT INTO` statement, and then provide values for only those listed columns.
    Example: `INSERT INTO Customers (first_name, last_name, email) VALUES ('Jane', 'Doe', 'jane.doe@example.com');`

9.  **How to insert values using `SELECT`?**
    You can insert values into a table by selecting data from another table or a complex query using the `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` statement. This is highly efficient for copying data, populating summary tables, or migrating data.
    Example: `INSERT INTO NewCustomers (id, name) SELECT user_id, username FROM OldUsers WHERE registration_date > '2023-01-01';`

10. **What is `ON DELETE CASCADE`?**
    `ON DELETE CASCADE` is a referential action specified on a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint. When a row in the parent table (the table containing the primary key referenced by the foreign key) is deleted, `ON DELETE CASCADE` automatically deletes all matching rows in the child table (the table containing the foreign key). This ensures that child records dependent on a deleted parent record are also removed, preventing "orphan" records and maintaining referential integrity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used

* **DB Fiddle / SQLiteStudio**: As specified in the task, these tools are suitable for writing and executing DML statements.
* **MySQL Server / MySQL Workbench**: Used as the database environment where the Task 1 schema was established, providing the target for these DML operations.

## üöÄ Setup & Execution Guide

To execute the DML statements from this task:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure your E-commerce database schema (from Task 1) is already set up and running on your MySQL Server.
2.  **Clone Repository:** Download or clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
3.  **Execute SQL Script:**
    * Open your preferred SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DB Fiddle, SQLiteStudio).
    * Connect to your `super_advanced_ecommerce_db` database.
    * Open the SQL script file for Task 2 (e.g., `task_2_dml_statements.sql` - *you will create this file*) from this repository in a new query tab.
    * Execute the `INSERT` statements first to populate your tables.
    * Then, execute the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements (perhaps commenting out `DELETE` if you want to keep data for further practice).
